PROJECT TITLE

Function Challenge 

DESCRIPTION

This project is a smart contract that provides functions for viewing, pure computation, and accepting payments. The contract includes functions for adding a given amount to the contract's balance and returning the result, adding two numbers and returning the sum, accepting ether payments, and adding two numbers without modifying the contract state. 

GETTING STARTED

To use this contract, you'll need a development environment with a Solidity compiler.

EXECUTING PROGRAM

Follow these steps to run the program:


1. Compile the `ViewPureAndPayable.sol` file using the Solidity compiler.
2. Deploy the compiled contract to a blockchain network using a tool like Remix or Truffle.
3. Interact with the deployed contract using its functions.
